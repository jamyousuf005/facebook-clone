📘 Facebook Clone (ReactJS + Firebase + TailwindCSS)
Welcome to MyFBWebApp – a simple UI project that mimics some core features of Facebook! Built using ReactJS, TailwindCSS, and Firebase Authentication, this clone demonstrates component-based architecture, proper state management, and routing, with a clean, modern look.

🔗 Live Demo: myfbwebaap.vercel.app

🚀 Features
🔐 Firebase Authentication – Sign In/Sign Out functionality

⚛️ React Context API – For global state management

🔄 React Router DOM – Seamless client-side routing

💬 Comment System – UI for users to comment on posts

👍 Like Feature – UI implementation of post likes

📝 Post Feature – Users can write and view posts (UI only)

🎨 Tailwind CSS – Fully responsive, clean UI

📦 Component-Based Architecture – Reusable and organized

Note: This project focuses on the UI and frontend logic only. Due to the absence of a backend/cloud database, features like comments, posts, and likes are not persistent – they are simulated in the UI.

🛠️ Tech Stack
ReactJS – JavaScript library for building user interfaces

Tailwind CSS – Utility-first CSS framework for styling

Firebase Auth – Authentication service (login/logout)

React Router DOM – Routing between pages

Context API – State management across the app

🙌 Acknowledgements
Inspired by Facebook's interface and user experience

Firebase for simple and fast authentication

TailwindCSS for rapid UI development

📌 Note
This is a frontend-only implementation designed for learning and practice purposes. No real database or cloud functions are used for storing posts, comments, or likes.
